    <p>Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of <a href="#"> Sikkim</a> Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.</p>


<h2> Nepal History </h2>

    <blockquote> By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India.</blockquote>

        <h1> Mountains </h1>

    <P> There are several noteworthy mountains in Nepal worth visiting if you are able. The first, of course, is Mount Everest though only a few ever brave the incredible and painstaking journey to the summit. The average visitor may spend some time at the Everest base camp or they may choose to view the biggest mountain in the world from another mountain peak such as  <i>Kala Patthar </i> which offers better views than those enjoyed at the <b>Everest </b> base camp. Some of the mountains are extremely steep and icy while others are not quite so steep. Some <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">noteworthy mountains in Nepal include Kanchanjunga, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Makalu, Dhaulagiri, Anna Purna, Imja Tse, Ama Dablam and Mansalu.</span> </P>
